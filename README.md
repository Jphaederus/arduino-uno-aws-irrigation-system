There is now an ensemble kit that includes most of the required hardware: <a href="https://amzn.to/3aN5qsj">WayinTop Automatic Irrigation DIY Kit</a>. But you still need to purchase the <a href="https://amzn.to/2CPxNt8">2 AA Battery Holder</a>, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2EqybyM">Arduino Uno</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ehh2ru">Jumper Wires</a>
<br><br>

PS:This guide works for both options

<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>This is an extremely popular DIY project because it automatically waters your plants and flowers according to the level of moisture in the soil. The list of item above combines the development board (Arduino Uno), Mini pump, Tubing, Soil Moisture Sensors and a 4 Channel 5V Relay Module, which is all you need to build an automated irrigation system.</p>

<h1>BUY VS BUILD</h1>
<p>You can always go ahead and buy a ready to use solution like this <a href="https://amzn.to/3laBGds">Self Watering System</a> for roughly the same cost. But if you're looking to learn Arduino development while doing a fun & useful project in the meantime, then stick around</p>

<h1>What is moisture?</h1>
<p>Moisture is the presence of water, often in trace amounts. Small amounts of water may be found, for example, in the air (humidity), in foods, and in some commercial products. Moisture also refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air.</p>

<h1>CAPACITIVE SENSOR</h1>

<p>Inserted into the soil around the plants. This sensor can check whether your plant is thirsty by measuring the level of moisture in the soil</p>

<h1>THE WIRING</h1>
<p>...</p>

<p>There are a number of connections to be made. Lining up the display with the top of the breadboard helps to identify its pins without too much counting, especially if the breadboard has its rows numbered with row 1 as the top row of the board. Do not forget, the long yellow lead that links the slider of the pot to pin 3 of the display. The potentiometer is used to control the contrast of the display.</p>
